np-cvthings
==============
This is a collection of objects, sketches and studies that i use as foundation for further creative coding works with openFrameworks. Mainly things based on kinect or opencv. Not all the classes have a clean API and i will change the interface as many time i need, until i eventually i make separate addons from the most useful and stable parts. Otherwise differently stated he code is licensed under GNU GLPv3 (some apps are MIT-licensed, there is written in the ofApp.cpp code). 

The repo folders goes into the oF addons folder. Everything is tested only on Linux, although many classes should work on other operative systems too... if it works it works, otherwise you have to figure it yourself, no support will be given.
